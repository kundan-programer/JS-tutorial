// String is the combination of character.In the JS we used both double as well as single courts to write the String.

const name="Kundan"  // ==> String
const surname= 'kumar'  // ==> String
const id = 886;
// console.log(name+" "+surname);  // concatination of two string
name1= ame.toUpperCase
console.log(`Hello I am ${name1} and my id is ${id}` );
